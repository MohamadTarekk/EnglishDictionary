# EnglishDictionary

This repository is a mini-project for **Data Structures 2** course at *"Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University"*.

English Dictionary uses **Red Black Trees** data structure to perform efficient searching operations in a list of eords loaded from a text file (words of the dictionary). It provides, as well, adding new words and deleting existing ones.
